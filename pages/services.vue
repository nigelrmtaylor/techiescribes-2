            Yes, this does happen often. But having your engineers writing the
            documentation is NOT the answer. If you want your users to be able
            to use your product without banging their heads against the wall,
            then your best bet is to hire a contract technical writer, such as
            me.

          <p class="text-justify">
            I develop and create user-friendly and cost-efficient documentation
            for your product â€” from the underlying didactic concept down to the
            detailed structure. However, be forewarned: As my documentation is
            focussing on the target group, that is, the user, the designed
            solution will most likely not be the solution that you would have
            chosen or created. The simple reason for this is that you have
            special product knowledge that your users do not have and you are
            not part of the target group.

          <p class="text-justify">
            No matter how wonderful a particular product might be, if it has
            poor documentation, it's highly unlikely that it is fully and
            properly used. Users who buy your software need to easily find out
            how to use what they have bought, without you being there telling
            them what to do.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Many organisations ask their software designers and programmers to
            write their user guides because they think it is a nice low cost
            solution. However, these generally lack the specialist communication
            skills required to write a good document as well as the user's point
            of view, which results in higher Helpdesk costs and frustrated
            customers.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Writing clear, accurate and useful instructions is a specialist
            skill. I am a technical writing specialist and letting me produce
            your product manuals and user guides allows you and your developers
            to do what you do best: develop your product.

          <ul>
            <li>
              I can create all parts of your technical documentation in the
              required formats. All texts are written in plain, clear language,
              well-structured, and organised into small modules.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you already have a documentation, I can review the existing
              version. I analyse your documentation both from the users'
              perspective and the creation process. You will receive concrete
              suggestions for improvement and I will implement the changes for
              you.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can generate printed or printable user manuals and different
              types of online help from the same, shared text base, such as pdfs
              and winhelp, htmlhelp, etc. If required, I can also produce
              different versions of the documents, such as documentation for a
              standard version and documentation for a pro version of the same
              software. Or context-sensitive online help and in-product
              tutorials.
            </li>
            <li>
              You want me to continue writing the documentation for your future
              versions? I will be happy to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              You want to employ a full-time writer for your future versions? I
              will be happy to train him or her in the system we selected and
              configured.
            </li>
            <li>
              Being a technical translator at the same time, I am well aware of
              the constraints and limitations put on documentation that requires
              translation; the need to create documentation with a clear and
              direct content, avoiding ambiguities, and that omits slang
              expressions or references that are too specific to one single
              culture.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your documentation is written by non-native English speakers, I
              can review and edit it. Of course, such an author does know the
              correct technical terms, but rarely does he or she have the
              necessary command of English to produce clear and understandable
              documentation. In this case I will correct the language in
              general, remove any ambiguities and colloquialisms, and make sure
              the text is well written and easily understandable to deliver a
              clear and homogeneous message.
