          Who am I?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
          I am a technical writer and translator producing single-source product
          documentation, online help & tutorials, and training materials in
          multiple languages.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I am a dedicated, well organised and enthusiastic professional with
            20+ years' experience in the software documentation and localisation
            field.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have experiences in diverse corporate environments working in a
            variety of teams: as a single writer for one or multiple products,
            as a member of larger documentation teams, and in globally
            distributed teams within multi-national companies. I prefer to work
            in smaller environments, with direct contact and interaction with
            the development and support teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am used to working in a development environment and using
            development tools, such as agile (Rally and JIRA) and version
            control tools (cvs).
          </li>
          <li>
            I am familiar with managing multiple priorities, adapting to
            changing requirements and producing deliverables on tight release
            schedules.
          </li>
          <li>
            I speak four languages, German (mother tongue), English, French and
            Spanish and can write in Portuguese and Italian as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            My special business domains are IT Systems (specifically systems,
            network, security and asset management) and medical software
            (specifically cardiac, pulmonary and vascular surgery and
            cardiology).
          </li>
          <li>
            I have worked with a number of different authoring and design tools,
            DITA XML, FrameMaker, PageMaker, InDesign, Robohelp, Madcap Flare,
            Microsoft Office, Acrobat, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Quadralay
            WebWorks and Atlassian Confluence, as well as translation and
            translation management software (SDL Trados and Translation
            Management System).

        <ul>
          <li>
            I took over and reorganised the existing product documentation of a
            small start-up company, I analysed the product as well as the
            audience to create the appropriate documentation in different
            formats.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to open international markets, specifically Japan, I
            designed a product's localisation and multi-lingual
            context-sensitive online help system, with which new languages can
            be easily added and translated using standard tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once FrameMaker limitations regarding different outputs,
            specifically context-sensitive online help, became too restrictive,
            I analysed possible solutions and then migrated 2000+-page-manual
            sources per language to DITA-XML.
            <ul>
              <li>
                This DITA-XML system has evolved and matured over a dozen
                release cycles and is now the foundation of one of my former
                companies' single-source documentation platform, allowing them
                to create such different outputs as multi-lingual
                context-sensitive online help and PDFs.
              </li>
              <li>
                This platform also feeds an intuitive "guided help" that I
                created, integrated within the product, and that allows the user
                to learn and apply the software at the same time.
              </li>
              <li>
                When wiki became very popular as a documentation support, I
                created another routine together with a developer to convert the
                xml sources to Confluence wiki, adding another output to the
                sources.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            I was an active member of a Confluence wiki support team and became
            an administrator, testing new versions before they were applied to
            the production environment and implementing modifications to
            plug-ins.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have created training material for software, translated it to
            different languages and held training courses in-house and at the
            product customers' sites as well.

        Why you should hire a technical writer to do your documentation
      </h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Technical writers bridge the gap between your product and its users.
        Documentation can make all the difference for your product: investing in
        a technical writer makes sense to make sure your product's users really
        understand how your product can help them do all their work in the best
        and most efficient way and all it can do for them.

              >Product documentation from the user's perspective:</span
            >
            I see the product from a user's point of view and thus work as user
            advocate. This results in documentation which is based on the user's
            work and demands, and thus makes it a usable, clear, and invaluable
            component of the product.
          </li>

            <span class="font-weight-bold"
              >Clear writing and effective communication:</span
            >
            Documentation is useless if it is not clearly written. However, this
            is about more than just word choice and grammatical expertise. It is
            as important to know what to write as it is how to write it.

            I make sure you are using the same terminology among the user
            interface, user manuals, online help, training materials, and sales
            materials.

            From layout and font to appropriate size for graphics, I make sure
            your content looks professional. Also, do not forget about branding.
            Your documentation is just as much part of your product as its other
            features and it should look like it with regards to colours, styles,
            graphics and logos.

          A technical writer makes informed decisions about providing the right

          the first testers of your product, they are researchers, advocates for
          your users and even publishers. All these tasks are performed, in the
          end, to enhance the usability and value of your product.

          Why is it most beneficial to hire me on a contract?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Many companies, especially start-ups and smaller ones, can neither
          afford nor do they require full time technical writers. In such a
          situation hiring a writer on a contract basis makes most sense, no
          matter the time required for the project.

          The primary benefits include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Cost:</span> Hiring a contract
            technical writer is less expensive than a full-time employee. He/she
            is hired for the term he/she is needed and only that term. You get
            good documentation and pay only for what you need. In the end you
            pay an invoice and do not have to concern yourself about headcount
            and social charges.

          <li>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Skill:</span> Contract technical
            writer are very specialised technical writers and most are only
            available on a contract basis. Their highly advanced skills
            sometimes apply to short projects, such as implementing single
            sourcing strategies, creating documentation sets, applying
            minimalism and task-oriented strategies or creating video tutorials.
            But also for advanced documentation projects to improve the existing
            content quality or the content creation process. I work with your
            existing writers, if you have them, or on my own.

            <span class="font-weight-bold">Experience:</span> I have a wealth of
            experience that I can draw upon because I have worked on a number of
            different projects in all their development stages. I created
            solutions to problems that you haven't even seen yet. As a

          When is the best time to get me on board?

        <p class="text-justify">
          The best time depends a bit on your situation. Is it the first release
          of your product? Then the best moment would be when you have all the
          necessary information and your specifications are starting to take
          form. If it's for a new release, I would ideally be included after you
          have gathered all business requirements from your clients for this
          next release. If you wait to hire until the product is complete, I'll
          be left doing a rush job without understanding the product properly,
          which might result in your users not doing so either. A situation you
          would not wish to happen.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          If this is too early for you, you should seriously consider including
          me at the latest when you are halfway through your development phase,
          when I can still be party to the decisions made during development,
          for the same as the above mentioned reasons, and documentation can be
          integrated into your development processes.
