          Localising a product is not just translating it to another language,
          it is a bit more complex than that. Before you can start to have your
          software localised and your documentation translated you need to think
          about a number of things to make informed decisions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do you only intend to do European languages, or do you need to
            preview support for non-Latin characters as well, such as the Asian
            or Arab languages?
          </li>
          <li>
            Localisation must be integrated into your source code. How best to
            do this with minimum of rewriting of the existing code and, at the
            same time, make it easy to add other languages later?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does context-sensitive online help need to be provided? If yes, the
            same questions and decisions apply as for localisation.

          What I can do for you:
        </h2>

        <p class="text-justify">
          Translating and localising, is a specialist task. Contrary to popular
          opinion, having learned a foreign language or lived abroad for a few
          years isn't enough to do produce high quality translations. Not even
          with the help of automated translation systems - or rather, especially
          not. I am a certified translator for English, German and Spanish and
          French as a secondary language.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I can localise your product to different languages and manage the
            localisation to the languages I do not speak. Having written the
            documentation and knowing the product it describes, results in real
            localisation and not just word by word translation.
          </li>

          <li>
            Most software is written in English in its source, however, if your
            developers are more comfortable in French, German, Spanish, Italian
            or Portuguese as the GUI source, I can provide you with the English
            version for it. If your developers are non-native English speakers
            but have written the original GUI in English anyway, I can verify
            this version.
          </li>
          <li>
            I provide you with a single interface to translate into all
            different languages you need. I can translate your documentation to
            some languages and manage the translation to the languages I do not
            speak. For the languages I cannot do myself and to guarantee that
            all translations are done by native speakers I work with an
            established translation agency with whom I have a long-standing
            relationship.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Translating or editing the documentation to at least one other
          language by someone who knows the product allows an extra level of
          verification of the documentation. Is it really understandable? If the
          translator doesn't understand a phrase, a customer more than probably
          won't either.

        <h3 class="title font-regular">Analysing the source text</h3>
        <p>
          Analysing the original source does not just mean to go through with a
          fine comb, it very often implies asking a number of questions to make
          to eliminate any ambiguity and correctly understand some rather not
          understandable turn or phrases in the document. Working closely
          together on this with the customer is a key factor for the quality of
          the final documents.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title font-regular">Creating glossaries</h3>
        <p>
          Terminological research is fundamental for a precise translation of
          the source text, specifically when it concerns technical documents. If
          you already have glossaries or previous translations, please send them
          with your source documents; they are a very precious source and can
          avoid a number of questions. After a first run-through the sources I
          will provide you with a list of questions to answer and terms to
          validate. Thus you can ensure the homogeneous usage of terminology in
          all your documents for all your languages.
