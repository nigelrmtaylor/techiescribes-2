          Manuals
        </h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The standard form in which all product manuals are delivered are
          printed (or printable) manuals, online help and web pages (wikis).
          Depending on the product and audience these may be in different
          formats all of which I can create:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Some manuals, such as quick-start guides are still printed and
            delivered with the product.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most print-type manuals are nowadays provided in pdf format for
            download, to be either viewed on the screen or printed out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Almost all software products still come with a context-sensitive
            online help, mostly html-help, which is either included in the
            product, or guide you to an online version of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            A different, not context-sensitive type of online help can also be
            available on the internet or it can exist in the form of a wiki.

          Embedded Help and Tutorials
        </h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
          We shouldn't fool ourselves. Users do not like manuals, and they do
          not like online help either. Users want to get their job done. They
          don't want to spend time reading instead of working. Most users use
          documentation only as a last resort when they have problems - if they
          ever read it at all. Moreover, they don't like the idea that they need
          help at all.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Therefore, the best form of assistance is assistance that the user
          doesn't even notice as help. It is just around incidentally when
          needed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          I can develop an integrated performance support concept and
          information solution that goes well beyond standard documentation and
          basic online help. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a decision about which information can be directly embedded into the
            user interface (UI/GUI) of your software rather than into separate
            technical documentation, such as user manuals or help files
          </li>
          <li>
            a decision about how and where this information is displayed
          </li>
          <li>
            writing the texts

          Training Material
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Although technical documentation, presentation materials, and
            training materials are not the same, they have a lot in common:
            Complex technical information must be described easily and
            effectively.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Often, training materials can essentially be derived from printed
            documentation (single sourcing). Even screenshots can be used more
            than once: as a component of a tutorial, embedded into online help,
            and for presentation purposes on a web site.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            For maximum efficiency, a comprehensive solution should, therefore,
            include the full spectrum of user information.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            I can support you along the whole way from the concept to the final

          There are a number of benefits to having good procedures manuals,

          Bad documentation can lead to accidents, many unnecessary support

            Different version of the content, for example one pdf-version for

          Structured Authoring - DITA XML
        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Structured authoring is a publishing workflow that separates content
          from its format. This way the documenter can concentrate on writing
          the content, without having to pay constant attention to the
          formatting. The formatting rules are defined in a separate document
          and apply to the whole of the documentation and it is the system, not
          a writer or editor, that makes sure that the defined rules are
          applied.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Structured authoring also implies that the documentation is broken
          down into very small modules, topics, concepts, tasks and references,
          that can be reused wherever needed and thus remove the need of copy
          and pasting parts to other places.

          Process of Documentation
        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Documentation does not only consist of writing product content and
          instructions. Before the first word can be written a number of
          prerequisites must be fulfilled, the most important are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The documentation plan for the current product release must be
            written.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you already have a documentation process? If not one must be
            developed. It does not have to be very extensive, certainly not as
            minutely detailed as your documentation processes, but some sort of
            process should exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you have style sheets and templates? They are necessary if the
            different types of documentation and other company documents are to
            have a consistent look'n feel - corporate unity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you have a terminology list? This list will ensure that
            throughout your UI as well as in the product documentation (and the
            documents of other departments as well) is consistently used. It
            also provides a solid base for translation, should you already have
            a localised product or decide to start localising it.
